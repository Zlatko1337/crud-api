	Simple REST service that manages list of products. Made using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA and Postgres.	
	Written in few hours as a coding challenge. 



#CODING CHALLENGE TASK (pdf in resources)

	Create a REST web service using the following technology stack:
	● Java 8+
	● Maven or Gradle
	● Git
	● Spring Boot + Spring MVC
	● Data persistence technology of your choice
	● Postgres database
	The outcome of this assignment should be a simple REST service that manages a list of
	products. Project README must include steps for setting up the local environment. Project
	should be delivered as a link to the source repository (Github, Bitbucket, etc.).
	The work should contain the following parts:
	● Product model
	● REST CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for Product
		○ price in USD should be calculated by calling HNB API

#MODEL

	Product
	● id (autogenerated)
	● code (unique) (exactly 10 characters)
	● name
	● price_eur (>= 0)
	● price_usd (>= 0)
	● description
	● is_available (boolean)


#INSTALLING AND RUNNING

	Prerequests: Java 17 JRE, Postgresql 15 on standard port with database name and credentials as seen in *.properties files (dont write credentials in config files like this in real life). Before running the .jar make sure nothing is running on port 8080:
	$ netstat -ano | findStr "8080"
	$ taskkill /F /PID process_running_on_port_8080
	
	When everthing is set up run it like any other java program:
	$ java -jar crud-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

	Request examples are in src/main/resources/docs-api.txt.
